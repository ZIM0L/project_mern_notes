1. Git clone repo
2. Use command below in frontend and backend folder
```
npm i
```
3. To ensure the server works, you need the .env file, which only I possess.
4. Type this command in /backend folder to start a server
```
npm run localStart
```
5. Type this command in /frontend folder to run a site
```
npm run dev
```
Your site address will be http://localhost:PORT/

TIP: I advice to run 2 seperate terminals in vscode

There are 3 sites
http://localhost:PORT/ - main dashboard
http://localhost:PORT/* - Page not found
http://localhost:PORT/login - test login and password
